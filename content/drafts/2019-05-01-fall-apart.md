I don't know, sarah. this is some heavy stuff for you to be reposting and posting on your first go.

maybe try for something lighter.

As time goes on, we eventually learn that perfect records are made to be broken. Simply put, on a long enough timeline, one of the surest certainties is that everyone does, in fact, die. What comes together must be allowed to fall apart.

Does the weather care if you're motivated or not? Will a chill wind still blow, regardless of how positive you are in spite of obstacle? Sometimes, there's no avoiding pain. So you learn to accept it

From the [Queer Nature](https://www.queernature.org/) page

> Sometimes we need to fall apart—dare I say regularly in this society. People scream “self-care” when actually what we really need is “community-care” in this hyper-individualist culture. How do we co-create the conditions for our community members to fall apart and have their hearts crack open during immense ecological loss?  
>
> I am going off to the red wall canyons to apprentice to one who has taught me most about the dignity of falling apart and of the beauty of dismemberment: beloved cottonwoods. These riparian majesties thrive on flood plains and regularly dismember their limbs that no longer serve. Their rattling leaves are an essential song pointing to water in seemingly harsh desert-scapes.  
>
> This is where I make a nest to fall apart within my family of beings. This is where I will be tender to myself and call in “community-care” with my ecological kin as I lovingly pick up pieces of myself. This is where tears will shed and I will scream the aching losses my 30th year brought with my ancestors as witness. To surviving chronic academic abuse within a graduate program that “centered” decolonization that left me in deep self-doubt and agonizing hopelessness. I will massage my grief into the earth during the age of ecological collapse and pathos of species isolation. My chthonic rage will rise into a thousand cryptobiotic soil filaments that will co-create stability for the future generations of feathered, scaled, fanged, furred kin. You will hear my name dissolve into the rhythm of the gurgling creek until the edges of self + ecology blur (since they were never there to begin with). Through encounter with darkness, we will be rattled by the remembrance of who we are… people of kin, people of soil, people of prayer. Then we will serve our people.

Their experience is obviously different from ours, but like... I dunno. I feel like its relevant. I can't say I have the confidence that we could have this experience on Sunday, but maybe it'd be enough to think about it and be in nature and try to connect to it and shed the rest for a day. Just be alone, together, and let ourselves fall apart in a safe way, in a natural place, and recompose ourselves for the next battle. 



```txt
I do not claim to have any particular genius. But sometimes, I dream 
that I’m sitting in a dusky room at a kitchen table across from another 
version of me, who sits, unbound by time, quietly drinking a cup of tea.

“I wish you’d visit more often,” she tells me. And I wonder if that 
searing middle-of-the-night pain that, at times, settles like dread 
around my solar plexus may not only be because there’s so little 
unbroken time to tell my own untold stories, but because I’m afraid that
what may be coiled inside may not be worth paying attention to anyway. 
Perhaps that’s what I don’t want to face in that dusky room I dream of.
