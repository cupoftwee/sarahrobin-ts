I miss  Mac OS X. I was there when it clumsily took over for OS 9, glitzy plastic and compatibility errors and all. It was the first operating system I really looked under the hood at. I remember finding icon and theme customization options finding [Candybar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CandyBar) and [IconFactory](https://freeware.iconfactory.com) and playing around with user interface design for the first time. 

When I started dabbling in Linux and web design, I found out my mac could do most of the things my Linux machine could, and it could run the Adobe products that paid my bills at the time. OS X was the operating system that did it all for me - design, video, coding, illustration, whatever. 

As time went on, it felt more and more hostile. If you've used Apple devices between 2015 and 2020 (or read similar numerous complaints), you're probably aware of the growing discontent as Apple's primary business became oriented as a whole around iOS and services and the company grew ever-more gigantic. 

I still use a Mac - a 2017 laptop with a bad keyboard and a busted screen. I could repair it, but its easier to use with the bluetooth keyboard and magic trackpad from my 2008 Mac Mini instead of its built-in keyboard. I don't know if I'll be getting another mac for a while. But this machine feels more like the overpolished, underfunctional Mac OS than it does the beautiful hot mess that I miss. It has 2 usb c ports, and a headphone jack. I'm actually worried they'll take off the headphone jack sometime soon. 

As ten turns to eleven and the mess of Catalina and OS X is formally washed away with the incoming mess of Big Sur and Apple silicon, I just want to say that I miss OS X dearly, and I don't really care if my glasses are rose-tinted, and that the state of consumer computing these days well and truly saddens me. Cheers and goodnight, OS X. I'll remember you fondly.

One of the best things to happen to me in terms of career sustainability was to look for programming opportunities outside of web development. I've been a web developer and designer my entire career, and I adore the tools and languages I work with. Many can dislike CSS, but it was my first programming language ([Yes I Will Die On This Hill](LINK TO CSS IS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ARGUMENT)) and is still my favorite, warts and all. 

That being said, working in tech is, to put it lightly, exhausting. As an industry, tech is [somewhat]() [known]() [for]() [its]() [bs](), and if you don't manage to find a financially stable niche, you can easily get stuck in what feels like an endless grind of iffy gigs. It also doesn't help that often the easiest points of entry into the industry are platforms like [fiverr]() or [upwork]() where your work is heavily commodified.

Its very, very easy to fill your schedule with bs work that will burn you out. Everyone in the industry talks about hustle and grind. And what's the alternative? Side projects. More work, and maybe you can monetize it, if you're a *real* entreprenuer. 

I burnt out completely on dev and design work for a while. Nothing helped. What healed me wasn't the burning desire to better myself, or even the urgent need to pay rent and eat. It was like trying to play piano with broken fingers; after a certain point, willpower was not the issue. 

What did heal me was learning some basic game dev, and telling my own stories. I started playing around in [DragonRuby]() last year, and now I'm around 6 months into development of a dating simulator with a couple friends. The vast majority of the work is writing and art, but the programming is a joy. No endless libraries, no gigantic towers of fragile proprietary tools, just basics in a friendly language that's quite performant and goes

title: Why Linux? Why Bother? Open Source Creative Stack, Pt. 1

Over the last decade or so, I've kindled an ember of passion for Linux user interface design, and have been watching the community slowly embrace concepts like usability, with varying degrees of success. Linux, to me, still embodies a degree of autonomy that is rare in modern computing, even if that automony usually comes with more headaches than one would wish.

Over the coming series of posts, I'd like to discuss how I go about navigating the Linux world, why its worthwhile, and how to build a creative workflow in Linux for web design, digital art, and animation. 

Before I get into the details, I'd like to take a moment and address why in the heck I would even bother with this endeavor. Why care about a creative toolchain in open source software?

Frankly, because the tools that we, as a culture, give ourselves access to define what we, as a culture, get in return. Modern workflows are set up for corporate needs, workflows that only make sense when you're wealthy or under the protective umbrella of enterprise budgets. This may be fine for many industry professionals, but it functionally makes our artistic tools require independent wealth, scholarships, or piracy. 

I am not against people charging money for software. I'm a software developer; it is how I survive. What I am against is non-industry creatives being locked out of new mediums or forced to pay tribute to large corporations who rarely have their benefit in mind. Everything's fun and games until you can't open your portfolio work anymore.

There's nothing quite like the feeling of being locked out of opportunity. To tie my creative self to that locked opportunity seems even more dangerous. When my Mac breaks, how do I work if I don't have the money to replace it? It costs almost as much as a used car. Plenty of industry professionals will think this is absurd, but I want software that I won't be locked out of if my job doesn't see my value. 

I'm tired of living in a walled garden that threatens to break if I'm not as Pro as my Macbook. I want software that respects my personhood, my autonomy, my creative process, not software that dictates to me how I should be doing things and charges for the privilege. 

So yeah, that's the rant. Next up, we'll talk operating systems, and how to choose a distro that you can live with. Stick around!

---- MISC THOUGHTS

Deno for fullstack typescript? Deno is in rust. That seems solid. Also typescript -> rust -> any other compile target makes me think of gamedev. also what gamedev stuff exists for typescript?

https://css-tricks.com/want-to-write-a-hover-effect-with-inline-css-use-css-variables/ this is a really cool way to inject template data into styling using css variables. Thinking erb or phoenix or whatever.
