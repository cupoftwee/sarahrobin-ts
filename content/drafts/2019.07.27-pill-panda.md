## Outline - Working Draft
- Frustrations at the state of mental health software
  - 'Mindfulness' apps and productivity cults instead of tools to take care of yourself
  - Aggressively monetized - anything you put in is probably up for grabs. 
  - Official apps through medical programs always have a weird feeling that they're going to eventually be used to deny you coverage
- Design Solution
  - A web-tech-focused app that lets you log, reference, and visualize your health data, esp. wrt medication tracking. 
  - See trends in your own behavior easier
  - Logs, Reminders, 
- Technical Solution
  - Offline-first PWA - easily distributable, works everywhere, accessible web technologies so that people may extend/repair as needed. Use PRPL pattern for performance.
  - You own your own data. You can import/export as you wish. It is never synced to any server unless you explicitly choose for it to be.
  - DAT-compatible - securely import or export your data to other machines or people. 
- Current Status
