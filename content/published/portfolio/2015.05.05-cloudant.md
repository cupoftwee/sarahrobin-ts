This was part of a project highlighting how Cloudant's customers were making use of its features. This series focused on [Release Mobile](http://www.releasemobile.com), and this diagram illustrates how they utilized Cloudant's Lucene Search feature.

This was a pretty straightforward project, but I had fun with trying to come up with a visual for the 'Translate' stage of the diagram. I ended up using a similar tactic that Google Translate uses: two objects, connected by a folded arrow, differentiated by contrast/hue.
