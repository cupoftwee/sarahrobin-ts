Before I started work programming and doing web design, I worked as a graphic designer & illustrator. My career in art always felt more fragile than programming, but I really loved working with people to come up with concepts and bring them to life.

I stumbled on a couple old logotype concepts I put together for a potential client a few years back. In retrospect, the design's fairly derivitive (kind of had to be, sadly), but I do stand by the color choices.
