While experimenting with the jaw-droppingly fun [css-doodle](http://css-doodle.com) library, I ended up forking a codepen to make some rainbow clouds and gosh the results were much more vibrant and fun than I ever expected.

Can't wait to play around with it more! And if you'd like to play around with it, feel free to [check out the source code](GITHUB HERE) or [mess with it live](GLITCH URL HERE).
